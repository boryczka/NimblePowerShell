Nimble PowerShell Module


Copy all files to the module profile (use the download zip button)


\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\Nimble

you must have it in a folder called Nimble for it to load correctly.

will work towards making this easier.


This is a community supported module!

Examples:

connect-nsarray -name 10.20.30.40 -password <clear text for now>
get-nsvolume


still very early stage so help and functionality is spotty.
